# 🔐 Time Complexity Dashboard Edition V1.0

A research initiative analyzing the performance, efficiency, and time complexity of brute-force algorithms across different programming languages. This project visualizes how Python, JavaScript, Java and C++ handle computational stress during password cracking scenarios.

## 🚀 Overview

Understanding the speed at which passwords can be cracked is vital for modern cybersecurity. This project implements identical linear brute-force algorithms in three major stacks to benchmark their raw processing power:

* **Python**: Interpreted, ease-of-use focus.
* **Node.js (JavaScript)**: V8 engine, JIT compiled.
* **C++**: Compiled, low-level optimization.

The project includes a **Matplotlib Dashboard** that visualizes the exponential growth of time complexity as password length increases ($O(10^n)$).

## 📊 Current Benchmarks
*Data based on 9-digit brute-force stress tests.*


| No. of Digits | Python Time (s) | JavaScript Time (s) | C++ Time (s) |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | 0.00010 | 0.000013 | 0.0000057 |
| **2** | 0.00030 | 0.000048 | 0.000013 |
| **3** | 0.00057 | 0.000063 | 0.000031 |
| **4** | 0.0030 | 0.00037 | 0.00023 |
| **5** | 0.028 | 0.0056 | 0.0042 |
| **6** | 0.27 | 0.022 | 0.025 |
| **7** | 3.14 | 0.16 | 0.27 |
| **8** | 32.34 | 1.54 | 2.8 |
| **9** | 304.3 | 15.7 | 29.1 |

**Note: The data from Dashboard.py indicates that while C++ is faster for smaller inputs (1-5 digits), the JavaScript
implementation outperformed C++ in this specific benchmark for larger inputs (6-9 digits).**

| Language | Complexity Trend | Performance Tier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C++** | Extremely Linear | ⚡ **Fastest** (Compiled machine code) |
| **Node.js** | Optimized V8 | 🚀 **High Performance** (Surprising efficiency) |
| **Python** | Exponential Lag | 🐢 **Slower** (Overhead of interpreter) |
| **Java** | Will be updated | pending |

## 📈 Roadmap & Future Updates
I am actively expanding this research to include more sophisticated attack vectors and optimizations:
```
[ ] Multi-threading/Parallel Processing: Implementing threading in Python and OpenMP in C++.

[ ] Dictionary Attacks: Comparing hash table lookup speeds across languages.

[ ] GPU Acceleration: CUDA integration for C++.

[ ] Rainbow Tables: Storage vs. Compute analysis.

[ ] Hashing Algorithms: Benchmarking MD5/SHA-256 collision finding.
```
