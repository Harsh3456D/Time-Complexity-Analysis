# 🔐 Time Complexity Dashboard Edition V1.2

A research initiative analyzing the performance, efficiency, and time complexity of algorithms and non algorithmic scripts across different programming languages. This project visualizes how Python, JavaScript, Java and C++ handle computational stress during Several scenarios.

## 🚀 Overview

Understanding the speed and time complexity for research purposes. This project implements algorithms and non algorithmic scripts in couple major stacks to benchmark their raw power:

* **Python**: Interpreted, ease-of-use focus.
* **Node.js (JavaScript)**: V8 engine, JIT compiled.
* **C++**: Compiled, low-level optimization.
* **JAVA**: Compiled on VM, low-level optimization.

The project includes a **Matplotlib Dashboard** that visualizes the exponential growth of time complexity as password length increases ($O(10^n)$).

## 📊 Current Benchmarks
*Data based on 9-digit brute-force stress tests.*

| **9** | 304.3 | 15.7 | 29.1 | 6.56 |


**Note: The data from Dashboard.py indicates that while C++ is faster for smaller inputs (1-5 digits), the JavaScript
implementation outperformed C++ in this specific benchmark for larger inputs (6-9 digits).**

**Note: Dashboard will be updated with data.**

| Language | Complexity Trend | Performance Tier |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C++** | Extremely Linear | ⚡ **Fastest** (Compiled machine code) |
| **Node.js** | Optimized V8 | 🚀 **High Performance** (Surprising efficiency) |
| **Python** | Exponential Lag | 🐢 **Slower** (Overhead of interpreter) |
| **Java** | Extremely Fast | **Fast** (Java VM) |

## 📈 Roadmap & Future Updates
I am actively expanding this research to include more sophisticated attack vectors and optimizations:
```
[ ] Multi-threading/Parallel Processing: Implementing threading in Python and OpenMP in C++.

[ ] Dictionary Attacks: Comparing hash table lookup speeds across languages.

[ ] GPU Acceleration: CUDA integration for C++.

[ ] Rainbow Tables: Storage vs. Compute analysis.

[ ] Hashing Algorithms: Benchmarking MD5/SHA-256 collision finding.
```
